# Reddit Writing Style Guide for Persona AI Marketing

## CORE PRINCIPLES

### 1. **Never Sound Like AI**
- Use lowercase, casual punctuation
- Include natural typos/informal grammar ("ive" not "I've", "bc" not "because")
- No perfect structure or bullet points in posts
- Rambling, conversational flow
- Self-interrupting thoughts ("honestly...", "like...", "lol")

### 2. **Lead with Vulnerability, Not Value**
❌ "I built this cool tool that helps with decisions"
✅ "I'm stuck on a decision and realized ChatGPT is useless"

- Start with YOUR problem, not your solution
- Show self-doubt ("am I just procrastinating?")
- Ask for help, don't offer it
- Be the confused one seeking advice

### 3. **Reddit Hates Promotion**
- Never mention the tool in the original post
- Never include links upfront
- Never use marketing language ("decision engine", "AI-powered")
- Frame it as "something I threw together" not "my product"
- Only share link after 10+ people ask organically

---

## POST STRUCTURE

### Opening (Hook)
- Personal struggle or relatable frustration
- Specific, not generic ("2 weeks going in circles on...")
- Makes reader think "oh shit, that's me"

### The Problem
- Concrete example of what's broken
- ChatGPT/AI frustration (universal pain point)
- Quote the annoying responses ("well, it depends...")

### What You Built (Casual Mention)
- "Then I got weirdly obsessed with this idea..."
- Never say "I built a product" - say "I built this thing"
- Describe function, not features
- Show actual output you got (builds curiosity)

### The Self-Doubt
- "Is this even useful or am I procrastinating?"
- "Am I the only one who..."
- Shows vulnerability, invites engagement

### The Ask
- End with open questions for the community
- NOT "would you use this?" 
- YES "how do you actually make these calls?"

## COMMENT RESPONSE PATTERNS

### For Thoughtful Engagement
```
[quote their best insight]

[relate to your situation with honesty]

[ask follow-up question or share what you learned]

[thank them briefly]
```

Example:
```
the "permission vs decision" framing is what i couldnt put into words

when i got the "NO" result i was more relieved than angry which is probably the real answer

maybe im just building elaborate permission-giving machines when a quarter would do the job

appreciate the reality check
```

### For Criticism/Pushback
```
[acknowledge their point immediately]

[show self-awareness, don't defend]

[thank them even if it stings]
```

Example:
```
youre right, fair callout

i think i got so deep into "how do i make this decision" that i forgot to just... make it

appreciate you not sugarcoating it
```

### For Tool Suggestions (Claude, Gemini, etc.)
```
[brief acknowledgment]

[ask clarifying question to keep convo alive]

[thanks]
```

Example:
```
oh interesting - havent tried claude for this actually

did it give you a straight YES/NO or was it still more nuanced but just better reasoned?
```

### For Quick/Low-Value Comments
```
will do, thanks
```
```
noted
```
Keep it minimal. Save energy for high-value commenters.

## DM STRATEGY

### Who to DM (High Priority):
✅ People who've been through similar decisions
✅ Those who shared frameworks/methodologies
✅ Power users of AI tools (Claude, multiple models)
✅ Anyone who gave deep strategic advice
✅ Comments showing startup experience

### Who NOT to DM:
❌ People suggesting other tools only
❌ Those philosophically against AI for decisions
❌ Quick advice givers without depth
❌ Critics/trolls
❌ Generic encouragement

### DM Timing
- Wait 2-4 hours after their comment
- Don't DM immediately (looks thirsty)
- Space out DMs (don't send 10 at once)

### DM Structure

**Opening:**
```
hey [reference their specific insight]

[why it resonated with you personally]
```

**The Ask (Their Wisdom First):**
```
genuine question - [ask about THEIR experience/approach]

[show you want to learn from them, not sell to them]
```

**Casual Tool Mention (Optional):**
```
also if youre down to try [the thing] and give feedback that would be valuable

[specific reason their perspective matters]

no pressure tho / either way appreciate [their contribution]
```

**Example:**
```
hey that comment about passion vs opportunity cost really landed

when you said "couldnt picture yourself doing anything else" - how did you know that was real and not just romanticizing the idea?

also if youre open to it id love your take on the decision tool thing since you understand the LLM limitations

either way appreciate the reality check
```

## PROMOTION TACTICS (Subtle)

### Phase 1: Demonstrate Value (First 2-3 hours)
When someone shares a decision:
```
oh this is interesting, let me run this through real quick

[5 mins later, reply to yourself]

okay here's what it gave:
VERDICT: [X]
CONVICTION: [Y%]
KILL SIGNAL: [Z]

this help at all or just more noise?
```

### Phase 2: Create Demand (After 10-15 comments)
Post new top-level comment in YOUR thread:
```
alright genuinely curious - anyone have a decision theyre stuck on? 

ill run it through this thing and share the output publicly

trying to figure out if this is actually useful or another meta-productivity trap
```

### Phase 3: Reluctant Share (After people ask)
Only after 10+ people ask "what tool is this?":
```
its called Persona AI, built it last month bc i was frustrated with chatgpt hedging

still rough but here: [link]

would honestly love feedback on if the multi-persona thing is useful or just overengineered
```

### Phase 4: Edit Original Post (After 30-40 comments)
```
EDIT: people keep asking so heres the tool - [link] 

genuinely want feedback on whether this is useful or if im solving a fake problem
```

## LANGUAGE PATTERNS TO USE

### Casual fillers:
- "honestly"
- "like"
- "lol"
- "bc" (not "because")
- "tho" (not "though")
- "prob" (not "probably")
- "gonna"
- "wanna"

### Self-deprecating humor:
- "lol this is probably just elaborate procrastination"
- "might be building a solution looking for a problem"
- "accidentally built a product while trying to avoid building a product"

### Vulnerability markers:
- "i cant tell anymore"
- "maybe im overthinking this"
- "feel like im going in circles"
- "am i the only one who..."

### Humble acknowledgments:
- "fair point"
- "youre probably right"
- "that makes sense"
- "appreciate the reality check"
- "this is what i needed to hear"

---

## LANGUAGE TO AVOID

❌ Marketing speak:
- "decision engine"
- "AI-powered"
- "cutting-edge"
- "revolutionary"
- "game-changer"

❌ Corporate tone:
- Bullet points in posts
- "Discover how..."
- "Unlock the power of..."
- Perfect grammar
- Structured formatting

❌ Pushy sales:
- "Check out my tool"
- "You should try this"
- "Sign up now"
- "Limited time"
- Direct CTAs

---

## CROSSPOST TIMING

1. **Post to primary subreddit first** (r/Entrepreneur)
2. **Wait for traction** (20-30+ comments)
3. **Crosspost sequentially**, not all at once:
   - Day 1: r/Entrepreneur
   - After 5+ comments: r/SideProject
   - After 20+ comments: r/startups, r/ChatGPT
   - After 50+ comments: r/artificial, niche subs

4. **Don't spam** - let organic growth happen

## REMEMBER

The goal is **NOT** immediate conversions.

The goal is:
1. Build curiosity organically
2. Get people to ASK for the tool
3. Create social proof through engagement
4. Position yourself as helpful, not salesy
5. Let the product demo itself in comments

**You're not selling. You're sharing a struggle and accidentally revealing a solution.**
